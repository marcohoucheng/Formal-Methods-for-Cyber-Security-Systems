\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we have showcased an implementation to replicate the $\verb|check_explain_ltl_spec|$ function in the $\verb|mc|$ module of the $\verb|PyNuSMV|$ Python library. We have explained and reasoned the methodology used in our solution and through the Discussion section, we have ensured that our implementation is correct, has the symbolic approach and that the results from the algorithm matches what is required.

% OLD CONCLUSION FROM ASSINGMENT 1
% In this report, we have showcased an implementation to replicate the $\verb|check_explain_ltl_|$\\$\verb|spec|$ function in the $\verb|mc|$ module of the $\verb|PyNuSMV|$ Python library. We have explained and reasoned the methodology used in our solution and through the Discussion section, we have ensured that our implementation is correct, has the right (symbolic) approach and that the results from the algorithm matches what is required.
