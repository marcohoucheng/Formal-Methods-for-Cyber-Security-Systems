# This is file extends the coffee machine example
# The new specification adds the safety guarantee
#       G((gr & X bu) -> X gr)
# to model the option to make "caffe' doppio" by keeping the button pushed
# to grind more coffee 
# 
# 1. Test it on https://webslugs.ruediger-ehlers.de
# 2. Does the controller works as expected? Check if it can actually make "caffe' doppio"
# 3. Fix the specification to synthesize a controller that behaves as you expect
